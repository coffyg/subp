/*
THE ROOT ISSUE:

The main problem is in the waitForWorker function. The original implementation
waited for any worker to become available by using a notification system.
The new implementation uses polling with exponential backoff.

This creates two problems:
1. It doesn't properly wait for newly available workers
2. The polling approach wastes CPU cycles and can miss workers

THE FIX:

Replace the polling mechanism with a proper wait mechanism that:
1. Uses a condition variable or channel to be notified when a worker is available
2. Maintains the original blocking behavior for better resource utilization
3. Preserves the fast path for immediately available workers

This fix maintains optimizations while restoring the original behavior.
